# I build top performing websites and landing pages.

This is an example of a Lighthouse report that scores websites in key areas related to Google's new [Web Vitals](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en) that started rolling out in June 2021. This site with these stellar scores was created [for a special client](https://www.benevolentseniorservices.com).

Here's [why it's important](https://gravitaldigital.com/blog/googles-biggest-algorithm-change-goes-live-in-june/) to businesses, and [Forbes take](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/07/08/what-are-googles-new-core-web-vitals--why-should-your-business-care-about-them/?sh=5f8fc4f85989) on why you should care.

### This repo will serve as my personal site as well as a Gatsby Tailwind Twin GSAP starter. See it [LIVE](https://sparker888tailwindstarter.gatsbyjs.io/).

It's a work in progress started 8-18-21 that will eventually become a Gatsby 3.x starter that focuses on using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) as well as many commonly used [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins).

For now, I can tell you that the site base configuration started with the standard Gatsby site setup:

`npm init gatsby`

From there, the following plugins were added and configured (if not already part of the initial install):

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/gatsby-styled-components), [Styled Components](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/gatsby-styled-components) and [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)
- [Green Sock Animation Platform (gsap)](https://greensock.com/blog/learning/react/)
- [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem)
- [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image)
- [gatsby-plugin-sharp](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-sharp)
- [gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-shar)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx)
- [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-images/)
- [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-prismjs/)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed/)
- [gatsby-plugin-sitemap](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-sitemap)
- [gatsby-plugin-google-tagmanager](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-google-tagmanager)
- [React Helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
