# I build top performing websites and landing pages.

This is an example of a Lighthouse report that scores websites in key areas related to Google's new [Web Vitals](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en) that started rolling out in June 2021. This site with these stellar scores was created [for a special client](https://www.benevolentseniorservices.com).

Here's [why it's important](https://gravitaldigital.com/blog/googles-biggest-algorithm-change-goes-live-in-june/) to businesses, and [Forbes take](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/07/08/what-are-googles-new-core-web-vitals--why-should-your-business-care-about-them/?sh=5f8fc4f85989) on why you should care.

## Aloha ü§ô and thanks for stopping by.

I'm a üöÄ Space, üê¨ Sea and üöó Car Geek. I'm passionate about üì∏ photography and üñ•Ô∏è website design and development.

*üöß This repo is under construction - As of September 2, 2021 üöß*
## Welcome to the README.md for my personal bio site that will also server as a Gatsby 3.x starter that brings together the maagic of [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) and the super animation powers of [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) as well as many commonly used [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins). I'm also experimenting with [Simple React lightbox](https://simple-react-lightbox.dev/) 

View my site [here](https://sparker888tailwindstarter.gatsbyjs.io/).

**Why Gatsby?**

*Gatsby uses powerful pre-configuration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server side rendering, smart image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching. It's incredibly easy to work with. It's ideal for small websites, landing pages, and simple PWAs.*

**Why Tailwinds?**

* Human readable
* Low specificity by default
* Handles variations
* Modular/Composable
* Performant
* Doesn‚Äôt make naming hard
* Allows safe refactoring
* Extensible
* Does not enforce bad markup patterns
* Positive impact on developer velocity/productivity
* Reasonable learning curve

**Why CSS-in-JS (Emotion and Styled Components)?**

*I'll assume you're on board the CSS-in-JS train by now, but if now, I encourage you to check out [CSS in JS, an Emotional Topic devMode.fm podcast episode](https://devmode.fm/episodes/css-in-js-an-emotional-topic). There are some really nice advantages to working with Styled Components (CSS-in-JS), including:*

* Local Scoping
* Encapsulation
* Portability
* Reusability
* Dynamic Functionality

*For more details, see [this Tuts](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-css-in-js-examples-pros-and-cons--cms-33574) which also goes into more detail on the cons and some examples. I'm using it because I get the benefits of a hybrid approach to styling with both a utility CSS and styled components. I love being able to use the tw import to create new styles and define my components, clone and style existing components and mix in styled imports for conditional styling (and I'm still leveling up on the subject).

**Why twin?**

Twin blends the magic of Tailwind with the flexibility of CSS-in-JS! It leverages Tailwind's marvelous system and developer experience without the downsides of atomic CSS.

## Use this repository as a Gatsby + Tailwind + twin starter (more soon)

**Current Status as of September 2, 2021** 

sparker888-tailwindcss-starter a work in progress started 8-18-21 and I plan to have it completed on 9-9-21.

For now, I can tell you that the site base configuration started with the standard Gatsby site setup:

`npm init gatsby`

From there, the following plugins were added and configured (if not already part of the initial install):

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/gatsby-styled-components), [Styled Components](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/gatsby-styled-components) and [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)
- [Green Sock Animation Platform (gsap)](https://greensock.com/blog/learning/react/)
- [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem)
- [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image)
- [gatsby-plugin-sharp](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-sharp)
- [gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-shar)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx)
- [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-images/)
- [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-prismjs/)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed/)
- [gatsby-plugin-sitemap](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-sitemap)
- [gatsby-plugin-google-tagmanager](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-google-tagmanager)
- [React Helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

**Important Notes**

*If you do decide to use as a starter, you will need to remove the plugin for Contentful as well as the references to Contentful and the API keys in gatsby-config.js. I'm moving to Strapi, but this is a work in progress.*
