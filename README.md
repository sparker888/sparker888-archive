### Aloha 🤙

I'm a 🚀 Space, 🐬 Sea and 🚗 Speed Geek. I'm passionate about 📸 photography and 🖥️ website design. Follow me on Twitter at [@sparker888](https://www.twitter.com/sparker888). And if you're into video games, join me and my friends playing [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/signup?invc=bed0f5cf-ea4b-4c92-9128-b76165d69757).

Check out my [personal gatsby site](https://ecstatic-elion-b17c35.netlify.app/). It's a work in progress started 8-18-21, but will eventually become a Gatsby 3.x starter that includes [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) and many commonly used [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins).

For now, I can tell you that the following will be included:

- Tailwind CSS with [twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro)
- source-filesystem
- gatsby-plugin-image
- plugin-sharp
- React Helmet
- MDX
- Sitemap
- Google Tag Manager

You can also visit my [business site](https://www.gravitaldigital.com). Thanks for your interest!

### Fly safe!
